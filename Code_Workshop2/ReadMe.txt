KrossOver
Create a clock using Angular and Bootstrap; the clock should show the current time in hours, minutes, seconds and update in realtime. The time can be displayed as either analog or digital. 

Implement with the latest versions of AngularJS and Bootstrap. Utilize any version of HTML, CSS, LESS as long as the features you include are both standardized and widely supported. Use any tools you are comfortable with or anything that may help you accomplish the task. The solution should be submitted so that it can be run in any browser.

Bonus points for style.

Excel 1: Add ability to pause and resume the time.
Excel 2: Turn it into an alarm clock. Including a way to set the time and the alarm. The alarm should trigger at the specified time.

1.) In a seperate terminal tab or window, run 'node scripts\web-server.js' to start the web server
2.) open a browser window for the app and navigate to http://localhost:8000/app/index.html
