#Angular Restaurant Manager

##Overview

Create a client-side app that allows users to browse and update restaurant information. Each restaurant contains the fields described below. A restaurant may have only one cuisine type. They may have any number of contacts. Each contact belongs to one restaurant.

##Restaurants contain:

● Restaurant name

● Phone number

● Cuisine type​(see below)

● 0 or more contacts​(see below)

##Cuisine type may be one of the following:

American, Italian, French, Chinese, Ethiopian, Tibetan, Martian

##Contacts contain:

● Contact name

● Title

##Requirements

Your application should be written in Javascript using the Angular framework. Content entered by the user does not need to persist. The application should allow a user to create, edit, and remove restaurants. You should also be able to add contacts to each restaurant, edit them, and remove them. The user interface should be simple and self-explanatory.

##Optional

Additional features may be added as long as they don’t conflict with the stated requirements. For example, it might be useful to filter the restaurant list by name or cuisine type. Extra consideration is given for an efficient and thoughtful user interface.
