Tenable - Nessus UI Assessment

1) A server sends the following data when requesting 'http://[yourserver]/download/request?host=2'  :

{
"configurations" : [
     {
        "name" : "host1",
        "hostname" : "nessus-ntp.lab.com",
        "port" : 1241,
        "username" : "toto"
     },
     {
        "name" : "host2",
        "hostname" : "nessus-xml.lab.com",
        "port" : 3384,
        "username" : "admin"
     }
 ]
}

Write an HTML/JS code to send this request and display the result.

2) Use jQuery to add some style and design to the previous code.

3) Add some CSS design/style

4) Use all the javascript libraries you want and/or like and show us your skills on this small web application.

5) instead of sending host=2 you now send host=10000 and the response contains 10000 fields. How would you handle that? What could be improve to get the best performance?
	Increase more JSON objects count and increase the for loop length. To get the best performance simply comeup with a more efficient algorithm.
