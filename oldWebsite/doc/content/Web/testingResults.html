<p><strong>Observations/Comments</strong><br />
  Usability testers tended to note consistent minor issues with the site. Given the alloted amount of time, we were able to further engage the testers to find out what specifically it was that was confusing and given several recommended solutions, which they feel made the most sense. </p>

<p>We asked testers to complete the following four tasks:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Find the history of the museum. How did you arrive at the page?</li>
  <li>Identify the three images on the bottom of the home page. What do you feel the represent?</li>
  <li>Examine both the animated header on the home page and the static header on the content pages. Do you prefer one over the other? How do these headers work with the flow of the site and do you prefer one arrangement over the other?</li>
  <li>You’re looking to visit the museum - how would you go about finding their hours?</li>
</ol>
<p>The testers provided the following feedback:</p>
<ul>
  <li>It is difficult to identify what the three images on the front page are. Perhaps adding a label of some sort would help user easily identify purpose.</li>
  <li>Hours are easy to find on the Visit Us page, though it would be helpful to add to the homepage.</li>
  <li>Header images work, though their composition and alignment should be consistent. Animation on homepage with static image on content pages is preferred.</li>
  <li>It is important to identify the rotating image sidebar on the right side of the content pages. Similar to exhibit images on the homepage - clarification is critical.</li>
  <li>May be hard to read the sub-navigation. More contrast would help.</li>
  <li>Adding museum hours to About Us was also suggested once or twice.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Revision Notes</strong><br />
  Based on tester feedback, we have made the following revisions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Header composition is now consistent throughout the site.</li>
  <li>Exhibit images on front page are clearly labeled “Now Showing”</li>
  <li>Exhibit images on sidebar of content pages are also clearly labeled “Now Showing”</li>
  <li>Hours have been added to the homepage along with a link to the Visit Us section for more information on making a trip to the museum.</li>
  <li>Contrast was added to sub-navigation for increased readability.</li>
</ul>
