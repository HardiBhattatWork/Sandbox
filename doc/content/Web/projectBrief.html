					<h2>Project Brief</h2>

					<div class="entry">

                    	<h3>Project Summary</h3>

                        <p>The

Museum of Comic and Cartoon Art (MoCCA), was founded " to promote the

understanding and appreciation of comic and cartoon art as well as to

detail and discuss the artistic, cultural, and historical impact of

what is the world's most popular art form." To this end the museum

offers exhibits, school programs, workshops, lectures, award ceremonies

and a yearly Arts Festival.<br>

MoCCA is reconfiguring its gallery space and planning a new line-up of

exhibits, programming and events. The redesigned website will highlight

the museum's exciting collections, exhibits and activities in an

intuitive navigational design and attractive layout that reflect the

comic art theme. <br>

The single purpose of the new site is to enhance public awareness of

MoCCA and its many services. The secondary purpose of the site is to

attract new audiences, increase membership and number of visitors to

the museum and expand revenue-generating activities. In the long-term,

the site will serve as an integral piece of a major branding campaign

that will bring MoCCA to the forefront of comic and cartoon art in the

city of New York and more importantly, worldwide.<br></p>

						<br>

						<h3>Audience Profile</h3>

                        <p>The

target audience includes everyone interested in the many elements of

comic and cartoon art, ranging from storytelling with words and images,

to graphic art, to the history and many genres of this art form.<br>

Visitor A: Male. Avid comic book reader/collector. 24 Years old.

Frequent visitor of online gaming sites. Decent amount of disposable

income. Knows everything about his favorite superheroes, sci-fi and

fantasy books. On the site this visitor might search for information

about his favorite comic or artist, or browse the collections to

discover new books and artists. He may also come to the site for

information about museum exhibits and other events, to become a member,

or to buy comic art.<br>

Visitor B: Female. Graphic artist/animator. Interested in comics as a

form of graphic art and visual storytelling. She accesses the site in

search of design inspiration and to learn about lectures or workshops

of use to her. She might be interested in becoming a member.<br>

Visitors to the site care about comic art and want to know more about

the art form, its history, the artists, and maybe about how to create

their own comic art. An advertisement or flyer about a museum exhibit

or other event may prompt them to visit the site, as may their desire

to learn more about a popular art. When the site visit is a pleasant

experience and delivers what they are looking for and more, they are

likely to return.<br></p>

						<br>

						<h3>Perception/Tone/Guidelines</h3>

                        <p>The

target audience feels that the organization is well respected (the

Board contains giants in the industry), organizes exhibits that receive

great

reviews, and hosts important industry events. However, it feels that

the current site does not adequately reflect the organization, the site

is disorganized, stale, without coherent design (contains pages in 3

different design styles) and is in need of a makeover.<br>

The target audience should respond to the new online presence with

frequent and long visits, positive feedback, becoming a member,

numerous purchases and generous donations. Visitors should experience

the new site as a beautiful, up-to-date, fun, innovative and

informative site about comic art.<br>

The site should visually communicate the theme of comic art in ways

that reflect the wide range of expressions in this art. The visual

experience should be rich but not overwhelming or confusing. The visual

design should reflect the easy access to a wealth of exciting

information and activities.<br>

With the new site, the target audience will perceive MoCCA and its site

as fun, exciting, beautiful, knowledgeable, informative, trustworthy,

innovative and intuitive. Its personality should be perceived as cool

and intelligent.<br></p>

						<br>

                        <h3>Communication Strategy</h3>

                        <p>To

meet our goals - raise public awareness, expand audience and membership

- we will enhance the visitor's experience and make the website more

consistent with MoCCA's mission to serve as an invaluable resource for

a wide audience. We will enhance the visual design, improve on the

navigation, provide a sitemap, and restructure the layout. We will

facilitate membership registration and, if possible, add search

functionality.<br>



The overall message is knowledgeable and fun which will be conveyed throughout the user experience.<br>

We will see the success of redesign when membership and numbers of

visitors increase, when there is a wider range of visitors, and when

there is an increase in art sales.<br>

We intend to conduct a comprehensive and far-reaching advertising

campaign based in the city of New York in sync with the opening of the

newly revamped museum. The campaign will include posters in the Metro

system buses and trains, comic book shops, book stores and video game

stores in the city. For the week prior to the museum reopening, we will

have actors dressed up as the different superheroes roaming throughout

the city (battling, helping old ladies cross the street, performing

heroic feats, etc.)<br></p>

						<br>

                        <h3>Competitive Positioning</h3>

                        <p>MoCCA

differs from its competition in its physical location in New York City,

in the support it receives from a large number of well-known industry

veterans, in the yearly Arts Festival it organizes and in the positive

exhibit reviews it receives in journals and press. These factors make

MoCCA very well positioned to capitalize on the growing interest in

comic art from other arts and industries such as filmmaking and gaming,

and from ongoing developments in new media.<br>

The new site will build upon MoCCA's reputation and position in the

industry of cartoon and comic art with a solid balance of a consistent

and aesthetically appealing visual system combined with a simple and

intuitive user interface.<br></p>
